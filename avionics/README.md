##### [Firefly χ](github.com/curocketengineering/firefly_chi)
The proprietary brain of the avionics bay. 

##### χ-Ants (working name)
Modular, single-purpose arduino-based systems that communicate over CANS. 
These are designed to help other subteams perform simple computational goals
and to help us get auxilary readings across the rocket.
