# What is Avionics?
A general overview of the avionics subteam

## Wikipedia 
Avionics are the electronic systems used on aircraft, artificial satellites, and 
spacecraft, in short Avionic â€” the science of electronics when used in designing 
and making aircraft. Avionic systems include communications, navigation, the 
display and management of multiple systems, and the hundreds of systems that are 
fitted to aircraft to perform individual functions. These can be as simple as a 
searchlight for a police helicopter or as complicated as the tactical system for 
an airborne early warning platform. The term avionics is a portmanteau of the 
words aviation and electronics.

## Brief History
Avionics originally used c++ for an arduino-based system for SRAD.
COTS was an stratologger.

New system (firefly chi) is python-based running on a raspberry pi. 
COTS is an RRC3. 
COTS beacon is ???.
