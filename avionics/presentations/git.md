The power of version control

## Wikipedia 
Git is a distributed version-control system for
tracking changes in source code during software
development. It is designed for coordinating work
among programmers, but it can be used to track
changes in any set of files. Its goals include speed,
data integrity, and support for distributed,
non-linear workflows.
